```
Yeah　Uh-huh
Yeah, this ain't a game and you know we don't
play
Yeah
Uh, you ain't never seen the typa, show we 'bout
to show ya
You ain't never heard this typa flow, we
crashing on ya
Tidal wave, tidal wave, it's about to go
You will never dominate, domino when I see you
fall
Know I pop better get back, hand in my pocket,
watch the rocket blow
우리 걱정은 딱히 넣어둬 빨리, look at me on a
roll
Let bygones be bygones, I ain't never had no
problems
That high road, we gon' walk over 'cause icons
be icons
What you gon', what you gon', what you gon' do?
Lookin' good, lookin' fly, lookin' brand new
Unbelievable, 어림없거든
어이없거든 (You lovе it, love it)
When we pull up, know it's all on sitе
B-A-B-Y-M-O-N, we up, up, up
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, woah
Up like, woah, can you feel us? Feel us?
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, woah
This is how we do it, we go, woah, oh, oh, oh
Copy, copy, copy, copy 'til the error pop up
Copy, copy, wanna be me but you're never gonna
They all eatin' my leftovers, I left over what's
left over
Like ring, ring, come and get closer, we take
over, that's game over
Nobody do it like this, nobody, nobody do it
like this, uh
You're never catching me slip, I switch it on
with a flick of the wrist
Let bygones be bygones, I ain't never had no
problems
That high road, we gon' walk over 'cause icons
be icons
What you gon', what you gon', what you gon' do?
Lookin' good, lookin' fly, lookin' brand new
Unbelievable, 어림없거든
어이없거든 (You love it, love it)
When we pull up, know it's all on site
B-A-B-Y-M-O-N, we up, up, up
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, woah
Up like, woah, can you feel us? Feel us?
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, yeah
This is how we do it, we go, woah, oh, oh, oh
우린 보란듯이, yeah, we run it up, run it up
불을 지필 거야 burn it up, burn it up
세상 꼭대기에, say my name, say my name
우린 판을 바꿀 game changer, uh, uh
Definition dangerous, dangerous
Clock is ticking, ticking, buckle up, buckle up
Bet you never met a monster like me
I'll never stop, don't forget we gon' make
history
(We go up) 　Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, woah
(B-A, B-Y, M-O, N)
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 killas, killas
(We go up) Like, woah, 우린 villains, villains
Up high for me, baby, high for me, baby, woah
This is how we do it, we go, woah, oh, oh, oh
We go up
